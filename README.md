# Vert.xHelloWorld
An introduction project for Vert.x tool

# Vert.x -->Introduction
 "Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM."
 
# Why Vert.x?
 Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.
 
 Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent numbers.
 
 Vert.x is not an application server. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
 
 Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
 
 Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
 
 Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
 
# How to run?
 Get into the project directory first then try the following commands
 
 1) mvn clean package
 2) java -jar <path of the .jar file>
 (You can find out the .jar file from the target directory after the first command)
