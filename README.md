# Vert.xHelloWorld
An introduction project for Vert.x tool

# Vert.x -->Introduction
 "Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM."
 
# Why Vert.x?
 Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.
 
 Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent numbers.
 
 Vert.x is not an application server. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
 
 Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
 
 Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
 
 Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
